# Car Purchase Amount Prediction

ðŸš—ðŸ’° A small machine learning project to predict the total dollar amount that customers are willing to pay for a car.

## Description

This project aims to develop a regression model using artificial neural networks to predict the car purchase amount based on several customer attributes. By leveraging the power of machine learning, we can provide valuable insights into the factors that influence customers' purchasing decisions and estimate the amount they are willing to spend on a car.

The following attributes are used as inputs for our model:

- Gender
- Age
- Annual Salary
- Credit Card Debt
- Net Worth

The trained model will take these attributes as input and provide a prediction for the total dollar amount customers are willing to pay for a car. In real life context, this kinf of information could be valuable for car dealerships, financial institutions, and other relevant stakeholders in the automotive industry.
